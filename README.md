#P5-lib training
NeuralNetwork -training

Iiro Laukkanen, 2019

Normal Tic-Tac-Toe, but there is an opponent which is controlled by NN.
Idea is to check how training of NN happens.

Atm there are 25 opposing playerpairs and one of the players is user controlled.
Everytime user or opponent wins, another generation is generated.

#Next I want to add a training-mode, where NN can iterate over set amount of generations or some other goal.
#There is still bugs on incentive, the NN doesnt know what it wants to do.
#Also visually this project is very crude still.
#Inputs for generetion size, amount of adjacent marks to win, etc
#Statistics?
#Generate training data for most basic scenarios
